[UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT / DESIGN CHOICES]

Collection of code/tools to help for Django upgrading.

This package name is a reference to python package 'six' which was helping compatibility between python 2 and 3.

The idea of this package is to share some experience gained from a Django upgrade from 1.4 to 1.9 on a quite big project.
Have a look at `Django Upgrade talk`_ for more details.
django-seven will at the beginning contain compat module and deprecated rules logic.
Feel free to add any functionality that may be useful for your project by raising an issue, I will be more than happy to help you.
